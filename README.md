This is a collection of my arch install scripts. U can use all of em if u want, but if u wanna distribute it atleast mention this page.

To install the script u need:

clone this repo: git clone https://github.com/M1X5V/arch-install-script-MBP_A1278.git

enter the folder: cd arch-install-script-MBP_A1278

make it executable: chmod +x install.sh

run it: bash install.sh

Now it should install the system
